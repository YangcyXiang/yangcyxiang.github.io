### 前言
看的过程中想写点记录下来，但是 word 很容易找不到
于是想起来之前写的 github pages，和 obsidian 结合，github 有云端的存储与浏览，感觉应该还是不错的，试一试

### 篇章结构
一篇英文文献，内容包括
- Title
- Abstract & key words
- Introduction (Literature review)
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Acknowledgements
- References
- Appendix

行文过程中注重写作的要点在于 efficiency，言简意赅，精练表达

> When the purpose of the writing is to inform, efficiency refers to a style that communicates the most amount of information in the least amount of reading time.
> 
> When the purpose of the writing is to persuade, efficiency refers to a style that presents logical arguments in the most convincing manner.

### Title

> It identifies the **field** of study for the document;
> 
> It **separates** the document from all other documents in that field.

### Abstract

> Uses one or more well-developed paragraphs, which are unified, coherent, concise, and able to stand alone (200-300 words)
> 
> Uses an introduction-body-conclusion structure in which the parts of the report are discussed in order: 
> 1. **topic, purpose, and research question(s).**
> 2. **research methods**
> 3. **results / findings**
> 4. **conclusions and implications.**
> 
> Follows strictly the chronology of the report
> 
> Adds no new information - merely summarizes report
> 
> Contains stand-alone qualities - the abstract can be understood without reading the paper
> 
> Is intelligible to a wide audience

### Introduction

> Move 1a: Provide background context for the study by showing that the general **research area** you plan to investigate is important, central, interesting, problematic, and / or relevant.
> 
> Move 1b: Introduce and **review previous research** in the area in order to place your study within the “disciplinary conversation” on a particular topic.
> 
> Move 2: Justify your own study by indicating a **gap** in, a problem with or a question about previous research. This creates a niche for your study.
> 
> Move 3a: **Occupy the niche** by outlining purposes and / or value, or stating the nature of your planned research.
> 
> Move 3b: **Occupy the niche** by indicating the structure of your research report.

例子：From "SAW-Less Analog Front-End Receivers for TDD and FDD"

> **Over the years,** there has been an evolution of the architecture of wireless receivers and today the de facto standard is shown in Fig. 3….
> **Later,** many other have used it [2]–[6] to improve linearity and save power….
> **More recently,** the close correspondence between a multiphase passive mixer and a switched capacitor -path filter has been pointed out [9] and its potential for implementing high- bandpass filters analytically demonstrated [10].
> **Recently, another step toward** the so-called software defined ratio (SDR) has been taken by the blocker-tolerant, noise-cancelling receiver [2] that extends noise cancelling to the entire front-end.
> **However,...Furthermore, …**
> **As a further step in this evolution,** we report a SAW-less SE receiver with excellent linearity and blocker tolerance together with a good mix of sensitivity and bandwidth.

##### Move 1: Review

首先需要广泛阅读文献，涉及到文献综述

> Quote only when necessary;
> 
> **Paraphrase** if you want to keep the length the same;
> 
> **Summarize** if you want to make the text shorter;
> 
> **Synthesize** if you need to use information from several sources.

##### Move 2: Gap
| Signal word | Previous work                     | Gap & Topic                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Although    | studies have investigated X,      | few have looked at Y.         |
| Whereas     | some work has been done on X,     | Y has not been investigated.  |
| While       | much research has been done on X, | little is known about Y.      |
|             |                                   | Y is as yet under-researched. |
|             |                                   | Y has been neglected.         |

后面感觉没有总结的很凝练，就线不写了
Methods 部分注意语言表述的科学严谨与精简
Results 部分注意不仅仅是罗列数据，还需要给出主管的评论解释分析
